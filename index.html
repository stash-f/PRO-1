            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                The Pyramids of Giza were constructed during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom of Egypt, around
                2580–2560 BC. The Great Pyramid was built for Pharaoh Khufu, and it is the largest of the three
                pyramids at Giza.
            </p>
            <p>
                The pyramid complex includes two other major pyramids, built for Khufu's successors Khafre and Menkaure,
                along with smaller pyramids for queens, and other structures such as temples and causeways.
