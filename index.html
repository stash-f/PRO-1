            <p>
                The Pyramids of Giza are one of the most iconic structures in the world. Built as tombs for the Pharaohs
                of ancient Egypt, they stand as a testament to the engineering prowess and cultural significance of this
                ancient civilization.

            <h2>History</h2>

            <p>
                The Pyramids of Giza were constructed during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom of Egypt, around
                2580–2560 BC. The Great Pyramid was built for Pharaoh Khufu, and it is the largest of the three
                pyramids at Giza.
            </p>
            <p>
                The pyramid complex includes two other major pyramids, built for Khufu's successors Khafre and Menkaure,
                along with smaller pyramids for queens, and other structures such as temples and causeways.
            </p>

                <li>2558–2532 BC: Construction of the Pyramid of Khafre</li>
                <li>2510 BC: Construction of the Pyramid of Menkaure</li>

            <h2>Architecture</h2>
            <p>
                The Pyramids of Giza are an architectural marvel. The Great Pyramid was originally 146.6 meters (481
                feet) tall, making it the tallest man-made structure in the world for over 3,800 years.
            </p>
            <p>
                The precision with which the pyramids were built is astounding. The base of the Great Pyramid covers 13
                acres and is nearly perfectly square, with an average length of each side of about 230.4 meters (756
                feet).
            </p>
            <h3>Construction Techniques</h3>
            <p>Despite the lack of modern tools, the ancient Egyptians used a combination of simple machines and manual
                labor to move and place the massive stones. The exact methods remain a topic of debate among historians
                and archaeologists.</p>
